# Description: This module contains the framework for the traditional korean "chess" game of Janggi.
# Janggi is a two player game where each player takes turns to eventually capture the opponent's
# general. Each player has  general, guard, soldier, cannon, horse, chariot, and elephant pieces
# which can all move differently.
